# Sidebar 

Sidebar is a really good feature of the extension. It allows you to chat with your AI model from any webpage. Rather than opening a new tab and navigating to the website, you can simply open the sidebar and chat with your AI model or ask any question about the current page.


Some browsers do not support the sidebar feature. You can check the [Browser Support](/browser-support.md) page to see if your browser is supported.
